## Version 0.1.7 - Planned Release

### Overview
Version 0.1.7 aims to address several known issues while refactoring the project folder structure to improve maintainability and scalability.

### Key Updates
1. **Folder Restructure**:
   - Implement a more organized folder hierarchy for easier management and navigation.
   - Separate concerns between front-end assets, logic, and configurations.

2. **Fix Known Issues**:
   - Resolve the issue where the main widget changes size on cycling after an initial load or reset.
   - Address the problem of right widget debug outlines (blue and green lines) being visible outside of debug mode.
   - Fix the incorrect initial display of chores, ensuring proper white or red flashing states based on their due status.

### Known Issues:
- Inconsistent layout stability on initial load and reset.
- CSS issues affecting debug outlines.
- Chores not displaying their correct states on first load.

### Development Considerations
- Implement the folder restructure with minimal disruption to current functionality.
- Ensure thorough testing of CSS and layout changes across all device sizes.
- Prioritize fixing the chore state display issue to improve user experience.

## Version 0.1.5 - 2023-05-14

### Overview
The focus of this patch was on improving the widget cycling behavior, introducing a new debug mode, and fixing inconsistencies in the timer logic.

### Key Updates
1. **Debug Mode Toggle**: Added a new debug mode for easier development and testing, displaying widget names and outlines.
2. **Improved Widget Cycling**: Widgets now cycle independently, and manual cycling triggers a 120-second delay before auto-cycling resumes.
3. **Timer Fixes**: Resolved issues where cycling one widget affected the timers of others.
